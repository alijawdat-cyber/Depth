# Smart Routing Implementation - Ready for Launch

## 🎯 Purpose
Unblock launch deployment by implementing Smart Routing for contact form submissions.

## 🚀 What's Implemented

### 1. Contact Form Dropdown
- Added inquiry type selector with 5 categories:
  - **عام** (`general`) → `hello@depth-agency.com`
  - **أسعار/باقات** (`pricing`) → `sales@depth-agency.com`
  - **دعم فني** (`support`) → `support@depth-agency.com`
  - **إعلام/صحافة** (`press`) → `press@depth-agency.com`
  - **وظائف** (`jobs`) → `jobs@depth-agency.com`

### 2. Smart Routing API
- Department-specific email routing based on inquiry type
- CC admin on all emails for oversight
- Enhanced subject lines with inquiry type tags
- Maintains existing honeypot anti-spam protection

### 3. DRY-RUN Mode
- Safe testing with `MAIL_DRY_RUN=1`
- Console logging of routing decisions
- No actual emails sent during testing
- Easy switch to production mode

## 🔧 Configuration
```env
MAIL_FROM="Depth <no-reply@depth-agency.com>"
MAIL_CC_ADMIN="admin@depth-agency.com"  
MAIL_DRY_RUN="1"  # Set to 0 for production
```

## ✅ Test Results
All inquiry types tested successfully in DRY-RUN mode:
- ✅ General → hello@depth-agency.com
- ✅ Pricing → sales@depth-agency.com
- ✅ Support → support@depth-agency.com
- ✅ Press → press@depth-agency.com
- ✅ Jobs → jobs@depth-agency.com
- ✅ Honeypot protection working
