# 🔄 Development Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the development workflow and best practices for the Depth platform.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
```
main
├── develop
├── feature/feature-name
├── bugfix/bug-description
└── release/version-number
```

### Commit Convention
```bash
# Format: type(scope): description

feat(api): add creator authentication endpoint
fix(database): resolve connection timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(ui): improve button hover states
refactor(pricing): optimize calculation algorithm
test(auth): add unit tests for login flow
chore(deps): upgrade dependencies
```

### Development Flow
1. **Pull latest changes**: `git pull origin develop`
2. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Make changes**: Code your feature
4. **Run tests**: `npm test`
5. **Commit changes**: Follow commit convention
6. **Push branch**: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
7. **Create PR**: Open pull request to develop branch
8. **Code review**: Team reviews and approves
9. **Merge**: Squash and merge to develop

## Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict type checking
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use enums for constants
- Document complex types

### API Development
- Follow REST conventions
- Use consistent error responses
- Implement proper validation
- Add comprehensive logging

### Database
- Use descriptive collection names
- Implement proper indexes
- Follow security rules
- Document all schemas

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test API endpoints
npm run test:api

# Test database operations
npm run test:db
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-commit Hooks
- ESLint checking
- Prettier formatting
- Type checking
- Basic tests

### Pre-push Hooks
- Full test suite
- Build verification
- Security audit

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment
1. Merge to `develop` branch
2. Automatic deployment to staging
3. Run smoke tests
4. Manual QA testing

### Production Deployment
1. Create release branch from develop
2. Update version numbers
3. Create release notes
4. Merge to main branch
5. Tag release
6. Deploy to production
7. Monitor deployment

## Development Tools

### Required Extensions (VS Code)
- TypeScript Hero
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Firebase
- Thunder Client
- GitLens

### Recommended Settings
```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "relative"
}
```

## Code Review Guidelines

### What to Review
- Code functionality and logic
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Test coverage
- Documentation updates
- Breaking changes

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guide
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Frontend load times
- Error rates
- User engagement metrics

### Tools
- Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Sentry for error tracking
- Lighthouse for performance audits
- Custom analytics dashboard

## Security Practices

### Development Security
- Never commit sensitive data
- Use environment variables
- Regular dependency updates
- Code security scanning

### Review Security
- Input validation
- Authentication checks
- Authorization verification
- Data encryption

## Documentation

### Required Documentation
- API endpoint documentation
- Database schema changes
- Configuration updates
- Deployment procedures
- Architecture decisions

### Documentation Updates
- Update with every feature
- Review during code review
- Maintain accuracy
- Include examples

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Check dependencies and environment
2. **Test failures**: Review recent changes and test data
3. **Deployment issues**: Verify configuration and permissions
4. **Performance problems**: Profile code and optimize queries

### Debug Process
1. Reproduce the issue locally
2. Check logs and error messages
3. Use debugging tools
4. Create minimal reproduction
5. Document solution

## Team Communication

### Daily Standups
- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Any blockers or concerns?

### Sprint Planning
- Review previous sprint
- Plan upcoming work
- Estimate effort
- Assign responsibilities

### Code Reviews
- Be constructive and respectful
- Explain reasoning behind suggestions
- Learn from others' approaches
- Share knowledge and best practices

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Weekly process improvements
- Monthly tool evaluations
- Quarterly workflow assessments
- Annual strategy reviews

### Learning & Development
- Share knowledge sessions
- Code review discussions
- Technology exploration
- Best practice updates
